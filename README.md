# Hashmap assignment

Assignment from [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hashmap)

It is simple and kind of 'ugly' implementation of hashmap in ruby 
(It lacks methods to avoid collision but it works with simple data)

## Thoughts

Though we know how hashes work in Ruby it was fun trying to implement hashmap myself
